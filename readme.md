# Intro
Hello to every friend around the globe.   
I position myself as a data engineer, who can do everything related in data collection, processing and presentation.

It is prefered that you call me "gkxk"(randomly generated id code), cause I set "mechanical ascension and abandoning my flesh" as my long-term goal.

## Recent status
