# Intro
Hello to every friend around the globe.   
I position myself as a data collector, who can do everything related in data collection, processing and presentation.

It is prefered that you call me "gkxk"(randomly generated id code), cause I set "mechanical ascension and abandoning my flesh" as my long-term goal.

## Recent status
- I am considering looking for a remote job, I would be very grateful if someone could offer me the opportunity.(2023-04-12)
- The "xxx_data series" requires much efforts, and I'm working on writing the relevant code to implement them.(2023-04-12)
<!-- - I am planning to build up my [3d version blog](https://github.com/gkxk/3d), to complement the [2d version](https://gkxk.github.io).(2023-04-12) -->
